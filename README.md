# AutonomousAgent
Autonomous vehicles employ a variety of AI agents, each with specific functions. This includes navigational systems making route decisions, predictive maintenance agents ensuring vehicle health, and AI-driven safety systems responding to dynamic road conditions.

This is a simulation of an autopilot vehicle roaming in a contour confined space made in a visual form.

It learns to move within the spaces know to its graphics environment as a set of coordinated points(x,y) just like a contour. This vehicle is modeled as a boid pic.

There are 27 visual forms that can be programmed to stimulate the vehicular boid.
Only one contour is made for illustration purposes.
